My newest project is `fw_neopxiel_pride`, and it's a simple piece of
wearable jewelry for LGBTQ Pride month, built with a microcontroller and
CircuitPython. The project guide is being migrated soon, but you can
find the code on [GitHub][github]. The project guide is [here][guide].

Check it out, and Happy Pride!
