[blogging]: https://edidiongasikpo.com/why-is-it-important-to-blog-as-a-developer

As you might have noticed, this blog has been quiet for a while. I had
lots of good stuff happening last year, and lots of ideas planned. But
then...well, life happened. The COVID-19 pandemic hit, I was laid of
from my job (after nearly seven years), I started a new job, and things
got busy.

The new year has brought a little breathing room, and I'd started
thinking about how to get going with the blog again. So it was very
timely indeed that I read a blog post by Edidiong Asikpo, a developer
and blogger from Nigeria, titled
[The Importance of Blogging as a Developer][blogging].
It's definitely worth a read, but it got me thinking about my own
reasons why I wanted to blog, and why I want to resume the habit.

Here are some of my reasons:

## It helps me hone my skills and develop new ones

They say that one of the best ways to deeply learn a skill is to try to
teach it to someone else. That's why the mantra in medical school is
"see one, do one, teach one". I've found it takes solid mastery of a
concept to be able to explain it in a clear, concise, coherent way. So,
blogging about things I already know is a good way to strengthen and
clarify my understanding in my own head. Blogging is also a good excuse
to learn new things. If I have topics I'm interested in, the opportunity
to blog about them is a great motivator for taking some time to dive in
and learn about them.

## It's a chance to give back and connect with the community

Let's face it: When I'm looking for the answer to a technical question,
a good portion of the time, Google will surface a blog post someone has
written about the topic. Writing my own blog is a chance to add my own
knowledge, experience, and opinions to this vast global storehouse of
knowledge. Writing a blog also gives me an excuse to read other tech
blogs, connect with other tech people, and share/amplify other voices in
the community.

## I enjoy writing and teaching

There's not a lot to say here. Like many techies (especially, I think,
those on the autism and ADHD spectra) I've got a slightly repressed
teacher inside of me. I think it comes from finally being in a place in
my life where people want to hear about the nerdy things I'm interested
in. So my blog -- where I can write about whatever interests me, and
there's nobody telling me it's boring or weird -- is a space to let that
side of me out.

## It's a visible marketing tool

To be clear, I'm not actively marketing anything in particular at the
moment. I'm not job--hunting, and I'm not selling anything. But both of
those things will likely change at some point in the future. Having a
corpus of blog content that shows both who I am and how I think as a
technologist, and how I communicate technical ideas, is a very handy and
useful thing.

All of which is a long way of saying that I'm back, and working to
cultivate a regular cadence of blog posts in 2021. (I'm aiming for 1-2
posts per week, but we'll see how that goes). My new job is as a Data
Engineer for a health insurance company, so you'll likely see more
data-related stuff in the mix of posts, but I expect things to continue
to be as varied as my personal and professional interests are.

So, how about it? Bloggers, what are your reasons for blogging? Readers,
what keeps you coming back? And what topics are you interested in
hearing more (or less) about in 2021? Sound off in the comments!
