One of my activities is streaming on [Twitch][twitch]. I enjoy inspiring others, and I
also enjoy teaching what I know. [This blog post][blogpost] talks about some of the other
reasons I blog (sporadically), and they're the same reasons I stream.

## My Regular Streaming Schedule

My stream is currently **on hiatus** while I deal with some pressing health
challenges. :worried:

When I return, I expect to stream a mix of maker electronics, reading (ideally public
domain mystery fiction), and occasional [magic][magic].
