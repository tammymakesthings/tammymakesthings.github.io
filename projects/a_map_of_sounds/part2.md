In the [first part](/projects/a_map_of_sounds/) of this project,
we started designing a transistor amplifier so that my nephew can
connect a microphone and oscilloscope to make "a map of sounds". In this
next section, we'll revisit the design and then start building it up.

## Revisiting the Design

Before we continue, I'd like to take  another look at the design and
explain a few things more clearly. I've been watching a ton of
YouTube videos about transistor amplifiers lately, and I think
I understand things a little better, so I'd like to try re-explaining
a couple of facets of the circuit design. 

I also discovered experimentally that my simulated circuit won't
actually work in the real world. Let's take a look at the reason why, and
how to fix it. 

### Houston, we have a problem...

_Coming soon_
