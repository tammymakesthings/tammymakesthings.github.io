Hello! I'm Tammy. I'm an engineering leader, software developer, database
professional, technology nerd. I'm also an author, photographer, musician, and
foodie.

I'm an advocate for [inclusion and diversity][dei], for [LGBTQI+][lgbtqi] rights, and am
proudly [neurodivergent][neurodivergent] (I'm [autistic][autistic] and have [ADHD][adhd]).

My [pronouns][pronouns] are **she/her** or **they/them**.

## What I Do

In my professional life, I manage a talented team of [data engineers][dataeng]
who are currently
building data infrastructure with [Python][python] and [Airflow][airflow] on the
[AWS][aws] platform (among others). I'm also an advocate for company culture and
values, particularly around LGBTQI+ inclusion and neurodiversity. I'm certified
as a [Mental Health First Aid][mhfa] first responder and I'm an advocate for
caring about mental health in the workplace.

## Other Interests

Outside of work, I have wide and varied interests. (Yes, that's a bit of an
understatement - I'm good at understatement.)

I'm a contributor to the [CircuitPython][circuitpython] project, which works to
run Python on small embededd computers called
[microcontrollers][microcontrollers], such as those from [Adafruit], and I work
on various personal electronics and coding projects.

I'm a casual amateur musician (singing, a bit of piano/keyboard, electronic
music, and currently) learning to play the [baritone ukulele][bariuke]. (My
current ukulele is a [Kala KA-BE][kalakabe]). I'm also into
[music theory][musictheory] and I have a fondness for [harp guitars][harpguitar]
and harp ukuleles. (I'd _looooove_ a [Synergy Uke][synuke], but at this point
in my life I can't justify spending the money on one.)

I'm a published author, photographer, and photojournalist. I enjoy writing
and reading mystery novels. I'm also interested in how systems work and
what happens when they don't, which makes things like plane crashes and
nuclear disasters endlessly fascinating to me. I'm also a bit of a Cold War
history buff.

I was born and raised in Toronto, Canada, and currently make my home in
Arizona, USA. My not-so-secret ambition is to acquire an [RV][rv] and become
a full-time [digital nomad][nomad].
